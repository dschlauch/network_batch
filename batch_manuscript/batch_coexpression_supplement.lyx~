\begin_layout Title
Batch effect on covariance structure confounds gene coexpression studies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Batch effect in GTEx Project
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GTEx uses WGCNA to find common modules across tissues.
 [Describe GTEx]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GTEx Consortium uses state-of-the-art methods for attempting to adjust for
 batch including study design and expression value correction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Study design:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

To the extent possible, based on sample availability, batches for library
 construction were designed to include a range of samples from different
 tissues and to span multiple donors, so as to minimise donor and tissue
 batch effects.

Expression correction:

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

the effect of top 3 PEER factors, gender, and 3 genotype PCs were removed.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, neither of these address the "second order" batch issue.
 These corrections inherently assume that batch affects the location-scale
 distribution of gene expression independently and thus does not consider
 the scenario where coexpression is the feature impacted by batch.

[GTEx Supplement] [Reproduce this figure or remove it]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To demonstrate that this study is sensitive to batch, we choose two widely
 available tissue types (Blood and Lung) from the data [YARN normalization].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then apply batch correction using 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Center
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as the batch of interest.
 We then ran WGCNA on each tissue separately as described in [GTEx paper]
 and compute modules based on Topological Overlap Map.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then ran the same procedure, but subsetted the data by each of the 3
 centers.
 In theory, after correcting for batch, the modules observed should have
 been independent of the batch used to find them.
 However, we observe dramatic (notable? clear?) differences in the modules
 identified.
 We should really quantify this difference somehow.
 This may require a clever resampling scheme where we select samples both
 randomly and by center to measure variability.

Confounding due to sex in ECLIPSE study
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this analysis, we will perform a very common analysis: Build coexpression
 networks based on 
\emph on
COPD
\emph default
 vs 
\emph on
Smoker control
\emph default
 and identify consensus modules with WGCNA.
 
\emph on
Gender
\emph default
 is treated as a confounder, but is only corrected using standard batch
 correction methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Run ComBat on gene expression data, *including gender as a covariate*.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Sample a set of designs from this study which include varying degrees of
 gender imbalance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Evaluate the agreement between cases and controls with pseudo-R^2 from
 multinomial logistic regression.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 Determine the degree to which the agreement between cases and controls
 depends on the gender distribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While this data is reasonably balanced, we can use it to demonstrate how
 sensitive our results are to confounding that was 
\emph on
supposedly 
\emph default
accounted for already.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Very clear dependence of agreement between cases and control on the balance.
 In other words, with a strong lack of balance, we see weaker agreement,
 indicating that the results we DO see are a function of the confounder
 and not the case-control partition.
